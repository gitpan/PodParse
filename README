This is _INCOMPLETE_ code! Please do not use it, unless you have an idea how
to improve it. I (Kenneth Albanowski, kjahds@kjahds.com) will be acting as
maintainer for right now, so if you improve the code, please submit changes
back to me. Thank you.

 "Version 0.1"
 

Each of the p2* executables is in a runnable state (more or less) without
worrying about Makefile.PL, and each takes a single pod filename as an
argument. They'll dump their respective formatted code to stdout.

html currently does no separate indexing, although the steps are separated in
the file. 


ToDo:
 
 Add indexing, and ideally, I want _all_ formatters to use the same indexing
 database. This database would get installed as /usr/local/pod, or somesuch,
 and all pod utilities could use it. A separate mini-formatter could then
 generate the indexing.
 
 Add computer language environments, and restrict the heuristics to only perl.
 
 Add human language environments, and tailor heuristics and any generated
 text to that language.
 
 p2text was working _very_ well as last look, p2man less so. p2rtf is in
 infancy. p2html should be a useful test bed. p2texi is a pain.
